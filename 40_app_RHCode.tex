\section{Performance Test Code}
\label{app:PerformanceTestCode}

Performance tests were executed using two applications that were developed to stage a collusion attack at will.  The two applications are called the Reader and the Publisher.  Both applications are modified versions of applications developed by Callum Dicker \cite{Dicker}.  There were developed in Java using the Android Studio IDE, version: 4.1.3.\\
