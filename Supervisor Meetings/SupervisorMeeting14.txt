In background have a section describing rosu havelund in my own words and have an example and psudeocode.

Use the listing package in Latex for writing the pseudocode

exposed framework


Markus, 14:22
developed by XX

in year

various Android versions that it covers

you chose a specific one

for the reason of stability, also taking into account how many people are using this version

purpose of Xposed

means to intercept operation system calls

requires a rooted device

explantion of "rooted"

rooted is unproblematics in China - see newpaper report

but rooted could hinder use of our sofware, as in the UK providers try to disuade users to do so

-- introduction to exposed --

how the exposed framework works

in Android, all processes fork from a "super process" called psygoate

14:30
zygote

Markus, 14:31
add reference to biology

the xposed framework inserts code into the zygote process 

through this, it `spreads' all over the processes that are running

what is the zygote process?

how does xposed change the process?

14:35
geny motion virtual machine works with xposed
standard android studio does not

Markus, 14:36
documentation of the xposed methods

possibly, a small example from some xposed documentation 

documentation is only via API documentation

there are some articles that describe the xposed framework

14:39
10 - 15 lines of code in the background and the full code into an appendix

Markus, 14:40
references to the internet: rule is - just write "laste accessed on  date"

==== Xposed contribution ===

objective: create logs of selected system operation calls

list of the calls to be logged for demonstrating  informaion stealing collusion

=== section on the architecture of the monitoring system ===

Interceptor 

is the exposed module

that intercepts operation system calls

intercepter informs the monitor via an intent

Monitor:

analyses the trace in relation to a property

if the trace is `accepting'

the interceptor runs all the time in the background

monitoring begins, when the monitoring app is started

alternative design: let the monitor run in the background

not chosen as time consuming to implement

and does not make a difference when it comes to the querstion if the design is feasible

add a picture of the architecture

Note: architecture before implementation with xposed

--- Xposed in Practice ---

[what RA coded for this project]

take your code

and show 10-15 lines excerpts

and explain them

everywhere, where something "interesting" is happening

show the principle

but not all the details in repetition

14:54
from the write up the reader should be able to repeat the monitor
