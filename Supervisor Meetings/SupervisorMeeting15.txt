In the background describe the operating system layers, a section on Linux, Android and the Exposed framework.  Introduce the operating system stack.  Like a novel first act describes the people, place, time etc.


In the background section I do need to state which Xposed API calls I use and explain what they do.  Give an overview of the Xposed API, decribe what the Xposed API offers.  Then say out of the whole API which parts I am using.  Explain fully the parts that I use.  This makes the document self-contained.


Background will be 40%.


Put references in early because it is quicker.  Otherwise it may never happen.  In scientific writing every statement is either new and explained and proven or it is a reference to something that has been proven already.


Do a skeleton Latex document with all the sections in that we can adjust where necessary and fill in.


Don't bother too much about the version of Android and Xposed as this is prototypical research.



Jump between writing background and contribution during the day.
