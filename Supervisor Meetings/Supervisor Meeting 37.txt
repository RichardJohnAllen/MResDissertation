Supervisor Meeting 36 - 12/02/2021
==================================

1.  If an LTL formula does not contain any temporal operators then it only considers the first event in the trace.

2.  The semantics need changing


Let sigma be and alphabet of actions
phi is a literal

For all e which are elements from sigma, t which are traces over sigma, phi which are LTL formulae over sigma, we define:

Then the semantics of each operator.  Use the ^ to concatenate the e and t (<e> ^ t)
