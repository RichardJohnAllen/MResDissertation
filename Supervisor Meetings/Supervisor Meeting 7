Proposal approximately 20 pages

  Introduction 1.5 pages
    Place the topic in Computer Science
      Cyber Security - Davos say this is very important for mankind
      Android use is widespread
      Project is about mobile security for android

    Specific angle of the project
      Runtime verification and mobile security
      For app collusion and other threats.  Paper on prolog filtering

    Project aims
      Formulate app collusion properties in LTL
      Generate monitors for the LTL formulas
      Realise the monitors in android
      Evaluate the monitoring technique - does it work well, can it discover app collusion


  Related Work 1 page
    3-4 other related publications that are similar but say how they differ to this
    Talkabout the prolog paper
    Talkabout the model checking paper
    These are both static analysis techniques and differ to ours which is dynamic analysis
    Look into 2-3 papers for runtime verification and security


  Background 6-8 pages
    Explain fundamental principles of domain we a working in
      Android security

    Write about how the exposed framework works


  First own steps 6-8 pages
    Demonstrate first results that may have been achieved
      Put the code for the proof of concept in an appendix
      Put code snippets that illustrate steps into the text and explain the steps
      Put trace output snippets into the text


  Planning
    Feb - LTL security properties
    Mar - LTL -> Monitors
    Apr - Realise monitors as apps or 1 app
