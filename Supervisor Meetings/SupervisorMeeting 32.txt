==========

1.  Produce an adhoc LTL evaluator for the Russel club by mid january.  Use the standard R/H algorithm.

2.  In the Reverse R/H chapter the main thing is to describe what the differences are.  

Before point 1 and 2 say the first steps are identical to the original algorithm.  Try and find a graphical way to show the differences.

The difference are that the trace is evaluated in the opposite order, the registeres are named differently and the sematics for until are different.

Missing the initialisation sematics for until.

Regarding the next operator evaluate some traces against the standard and reverse R/H and see if the results are the same.

latex has \fbox that puts a box around text.


3.  Correctness proof is mostly likely to be by induction over the length of the trace.  We first do a proof on traces of length zero, then we show that provided we have a proof of correctness on a trace of length n we prove that the algorithm works for a trace of length n+1.


4.  In the chapter on R/H implementation add some java code after the UML.
