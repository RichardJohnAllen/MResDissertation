==========

Background Section

1. DVM section should be Dalvik Virtual Machine

2. Put Android Security as a section in chapter 1

3. Chapter on RV in background after LTL but before RH

4. Xposed Framework could be last chapter

So order is:

Android Platform
LTL * DONE
RV 
RH *
Xposed Framework *
Related Work





Contribution

5.  Change title of chapter 7 to Monitoring/Runtime Verification with the Rosu Havelund Algorithm

6.  Change title of chapter 9 to Modelling Collusion Properties in LTL

7.  Need a chapter on Runtime Verification Practise for Collusion and Other Security Properties.  Where we demonstrat that the system is running.




8.  In LTL chapeter remove the %% from the comments in the semantics examples

9.  Read the chapter on android sandboxing from Markus's paper Detecting Malicious Collusion Between Mobile Software Applications, The Android Case.  In email.  Explicitly list the protection levels and the properties of each level.  Give some examples of the features of the device and the use of the features.  Maybe a table of protection levels vs properties of level.  Some device features are critical and some are not.  Have a table of device features.  Look at table 1 in the chapter from Markus.

Talk about the manifest file where the developer says what permissions they require.

Where I make the observation that users accept all permissions merely because they have to, I must back this up with a reference to scientific literature or a web page on the subject like a newspaper article.
