BACKGROUND
==========

1.  Describe temporal logic, put formulae for collusion as examples (but possibly contributions).
2.  Describe the Rosu/Havelund algorithm, with examples
3.  Android operating system, how it works in particular regarding security
4.  Programming for Android
5.  Exposed framework, how it works and things that need to be implemented in an android project to use it.
6.  Related work.


Contribution
============
Section about scalability is different to description of the algorithm


Section of dissertation concerning the algorithm, this is part of the contribution

1.  Write down the algorithm in pseudo code
2.  Demonstrate correctness by example
3.  Argue why it is more efficient than original Rosu/Havelund
4.  Describe architecture (interceptor and monitor)
5.  Describe each half of the architecture
