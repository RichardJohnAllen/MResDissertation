Supervisor Meeting 36 - 05/02/2021
==================================

1.  Put a sentance summariesing the RH chapter at the end.

2.  Tell the strategy behind the test case selection.  Here the 2 inputs - trace and formula.  Question is why do we choice a specific trace and formula.  This is what we need to answer.

Testing
-------
1.  Test case selection
2.  Test execution
3.  Test evaluation
4.  Test documentation

Write about 1, 2 and 3, put 4 in an appendix.

In number 3 we have a summation of the test results.  Just say how many of the tests passed.  The appendix contains the results of all the tests.

Write about the automation of the testing in test execution (2).





Algorithms

Program - implementation of an algorithm

Verification checks that the algorithm works

Testing checks that algorithm and program




3.  In example10 where I describe the extending trace give T an index T_1, T_2 etc.  T' is T_n+1.

Keep description of what is happening in the example.
