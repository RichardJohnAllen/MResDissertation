Discussed
.  Markus suggested using the Runtime verification for LTL and TLTL paper as my subject paper for CSM-05 essay and talk Advanced Topics in Logic.  Write the essay on sections 2 + 3.  This requires a proof so prove the lemma in 2.5 or 3.8 lemma.  Theorem 2.7 follows from 2.5.

Give a talk on the same thing.

.  I talked about more of the RV paper.  Markus suggested I give traces as examples of T, ⊥, ?.

   φ := ¬pUinit

Traces in the notation or what ever is the notation of LTL
  <{¬p, ¬init} , {p, ¬init}> |= ⊥
  <{¬p, init}> |= T
  <{¬p, ¬init}> |= ?


 sigma = 2^AP is the power set of AP so it is all combinations of the finite set of AP

eg AP = {j, k ,l}
2^AP = { {}, {j}, {k}, {l}, {j, k}, {j, l}, {k, l}, {j, k, l} }

Which is similar to my thought of j k l and ¬j, ¬k, ¬l because where a letter is left out it is equivalent to the ¬ of that letter.

.  Markus described android project further and it is exciting


TODO
.  Read more runtime verification
