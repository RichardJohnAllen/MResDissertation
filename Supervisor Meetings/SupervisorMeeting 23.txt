Page 31 where it says the nodes are formula say it is decorated with a formulae - they are not actually formula.  Two nodes are connected if one node has the other node as a direct subformula.

Step 3 show a diagram of the registers.

Step 4 where I say about the initialisation of the next register put the truth values in that come from the empty trace.

In the second stage of the algorithm there is nothing that mentions referencing the next register when evaluating.  Problem is the semantics are in a different section and they are not written in terms of the algorithm.  Move those into a LTL section and have new sematics here.

On page 35 where I have operators for and and or use \land \lor.

\, is a small space in latex.

\ is a big space.


In the test section we have to decide if the formulae is under test or the algorithm.

We should be testing the implementation of the algorithm because RH have already proven the algorithm.  This means the testing section should go into section 7.5 (Implementation).


Section 7.2 Semantics should go into chapter 3.

Need to describe a trace in this section as well.

What is in 7.1 should go into chapter 4.

Chapter 7 should be 'Monitoring for LTL with performance analyses in Android'.  It should be the implementation of the algorithm + testing and then discuss scalability.  Say I implemented Rh and tested and had trouble with the scalability so I developed reverse RH, tested andmake remarks on scalability.

7.1 implementation of R/H
7.2 testing R/H
7.3 scalability/perfomance evaluation
7.4 reverse R/H
7.5 correctness proof of reverse R/H (optional)
7.6 implementation of reverse R/H
7.7 testing of reverse R/H
7.8 perfomance and scalability


In chapter 6 talk about a Generic Monitoring System Architecture for Android

Chapter 8 Monitoring App Collusion

Investigate more things to montior such as opening the mic.

Figuring out the formula for collusion should come in this chapter.


Will have to write in the background section about android security and app collusion.    That should be chapter 5 and related work should be chapter 6.

Future work section - there is a virtual xposed framework.  Was not available when this was started.  Integrate Xposed directly into monitor architecture.  Utilise monitoring for futher security properties.  Utilise monitoring beyond security but for safety applications.


Introduction
============
Motivation for the project.

Monitoring on Android was thought impossible due to energy and resource requirements being too high.  This project shows that is not the case.

Try to find references where monitoring is dismissed.  




Plan

It is about deciding how much time to spend on the document.
