                  Extra Code Required   Requires source code   Requires Specification    Exhaustive(all inputs tried) Should be performed by QA Can be performed by dev 
=======================================================================================================================================================================
                 |
Testing Black Box|    No			No			Yes		 	No			Yes				No - independence
		 |
Testing White Box|    No			Yes			Yes		 	No			Yes				No - independence 
                 |
RV               |    Yes - Monitor		Only adding logging     Yes		 	No - not considering	N/A				N/A
                 |				where not automatic				everything that could 
		 |				Must take over when				possibly happen.
		 |				monitor alerts					Impossible to consider
		 |										Infinitely many traces
		 |										in a system run
		 |	
Model Checking   |    No - Model often 		Yes			Yes		 	Yes			Possible			Yes
                 |    auto extracted
		 |    (possible with Java Pathfinder)
                 |    KAndroid extracts models (from related work)
                 |
Program provers  |    Yes			Yes			Yes		 	Yes			Possible			Yes
		      Work on original code										Might require special
		      (KeY, Dafny, Spark ADA)										expertise
                      Proof annotations
                      (can become bigger than
                       original code)



                  	Requirement coverage			When performed		Degree of automation
=======================================================================================================================================================================
                 |
Testing          |  A test for each requirement			Dev cycle		Development is manual 
		 |									execution automated in case of unit testing 
                 |
RV               |  Only selected requirements are monitored	At runtime		Expressing property manual
		 |  too much delay to monitor all					deriving monitor automatic
		 |									Evaluating property automatic
		 |									Response to alert is manual
		 |
Model Checking   |  All requirements				Dev cycle		Expressing property manual
		 |  									Model checking is automatic
                 |
Program provers  |  Selected required (costly)			Dev cycle		Expressing and proving property is manual
		  



Write about extra code required, exhaustive, requirement coverage, when performed and degree of automation.

Maybe include the table in some form.




2.  In testing people often assume a testing hypothesis as follows:  Provided a system passes finite test cases, then the system is correct for all inputs.

This hypothesis is often not proven but just assumed 'in a handwaving way / cavallier' and therefore safety and security cannot be guarenteed.


RV has a unique position in verification techniques.
