Discussed
=========

.  LTL formula for detecting sensitive information theft (from last meetings prolog paper).  Â¬(E(a -> E(c) -> E(s)))

.  Communication is a two part activity - a writes to a channel, b reads from that channel.  Need to capture this in LTL.  May not be possible to capture it in a proposition so there may be a java function that has to match reads and writes to the same channel.  Ideally we should be able to detect a chain of communication of unlimited length.

.  Discussed altering RosuHavelund algorithm to travers a trace forwards not backwards.


Actions
=======

.  Investigate altering RosuHavelund to traverse trace forwards.

.  Refine LTL formula for information theft with regard to communication channel (broadcast intent).  Two parts, write to channel then read from the same channel by a different app.  Extend in future to recognise communication across a chain of multiple channels.

.  Investigate differences between LTL and LTL3 and how those difference will effect our monitors.

.  Define an operator on traces for preceeds (a preceeds b) but define it with any mathematics other than LTL.  Then show that LTL is the equivalent.
