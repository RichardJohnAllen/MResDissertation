Discussed

.  3 areas of focus
  a) Vellemann book, presentation needs to be done by next week and essay shortly after.  Need to get going on this.  I have read most of chapter 3 but still have to read the section I am presenting.

  b) Study paper for presentation and report, making progress on this.

  c) Project initial document
	i)   Background - Read about the Android O/S from the Data Analytics and Decision Support for Cybersecurity book.  Learn how to develop for Android phones that are rooted.  Android Studio for Eclipse is only for non-rooted phones.

	ii)  First Own Contribution - Software to extend O/S calls and log them.  Techniques for doing this use the Xposed framework and are in https://github.com/idanr1986/droidmon, https://github.com/cyruliu/Sensitive_API_Monitor.  
		Should have something done by end of Dec/Jan that can log a single protected O/S call along with it's parameters.

	iii) Related work

.  Research Hypothesis:
  Runtime verification at O/S call level can effectively protect andriod phones against security threats.
    

TODO
