1.  How the project started:  To detect information theft by applications colluding to circumvent Android security.

Define collusion?

2.  Use of runtime verification to detect surity threats

3.  Rosu-Havelund algorithm to evaluate LTL over a trace

4.  Complexity of RH made it unusable in realtime

5.  Reverse RH solved this problem
