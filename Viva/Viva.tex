\begin{itemize}

\item In 2019 there is reported 3.4 billion smart phone users world wide\footnote{https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/}, 1.6 billion are Android devices\footnote{https://www.statista.com/statistics/543185/worldwide-internet-connected-operating-system-population/}.

\item Attacks happen to such extent that the McAfee Q1 2020 threat reports opens with the headline “Mobile Malware Is Playing Hide and Steal”\footnote{https://www.mcafee.com/content/dam/consumer/en-us/docs/2020-Mobile-Threat-Report.pdf}.

\item We are monitoring for security on one concrete example: app collusion for information theft.

%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item Linux Kernel separates processes into sandboxes where they are unable to reference each others address space directly.
%
%\item Android restricts access to sensitive resources to only those applications that have been granted permission by the user.
%
%\item Applications can communicate with each other to enhance features but this can be exploited to share permissions.

\frame{\frametitle{Collusion: Specific Attack On Android}

By collusion we mean where two or more applications communicate between themselves in order to use their combined permissions to perform malicious activities like stealing information.  

This was theorised at least as early as 2011 and found to be occurring in 2017 \footnote{J. Blasco, T. Chen, I. Muttik, and M. Roggenbach.  Detection of app collusion potential using logic programming.  Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 105, 06 2017}.

%General Definition\footnote{Asavoae et al: Detecting Malicious Collusion Between Mobile Software.  Applications: The Android Case.  Data Analytics and Decision Support for Cybersecurity, Springer 2017}:  There is a non-singleton set S of apps performing a threat such that:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item Each app in S contributes the execution of at least one action to the threat.
%\item Each app in S communicates with at least one other app.

\frame{\frametitle{Rosu-Havelund Algorithm}

We attempted to use the Rosu-Havelund Algorithm \footnote{Grigore Rosu and Klaus Havelund.  Synthesizing Dynamic Programming Algorithms from Linear Temporal Logic Formulae.  RIACS, 2001} as an alternative to Buchi automata to evaluate LTL over a trace.

\begin{itemize}

\item Uses logic of the `future', i.e, Always $\square$, Eventually $\diamond$, Next $\circ$, Until $U$.
\item Collusion For Information Theft between two apps: $\diamond(q \land (\diamond s \land (\diamond r \land (\diamond p ))))$.
\item Traverses the trace from the latest event to the earliest to implement future operators.
\item Each time an event occurs the trace grows and the computational steps to evaluate the trace increases.
\item We theorise the number of computational steps follows n(n+1)/2, therefore the complexity is $O(n^2 * |\varphi|)$ where $n$ is the number of events in the trace and $\varphi$ is the size of the formula.
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Reverse Rosu-Havelund Algorithm}

\begin{itemize}

\item Traverses the traces in the opposite direction to standard R/H algorithm.

\item Reduces complexity in realtime monitoring by reusing the result of the previous evaluation, therefore only the latest event has to be evaluated.

\item Comes at the expense that the LTL operators that deal with future events (next, eventually) cannot be implemented because we do not know what future events will be.  Operators that are concerned with past events are implemented (previous, once) instead.

\item Collusion property expressed with past operators: $$ \diamonddash(p \land \diamonddash(r \land \diamonddash(s \land \diamonddash q))) $$

\end{itemize}

%
%The Once, \diamonddash, operator described by Pnueli\footnote{Zohar Manna, Amir Pnueli.  The Temporal Logic of Reactive and Concurrent Systems.  Springer-Verlag 1992} holds if an event has occurred in the present or at some preceding time.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item Once semantics:  $(\sigma, j) \models \diamonddash p\ iff\ (\sigma, k) \models p\ for\ some\ k,\ 0 \leq k \leq j$.
%\item Eventually semantics, for comparison:  $(\sigma, j) \models \diamond p\ iff\ (\sigma, k) \models p\ for\ some\ k,\ k \geq j$.

%\frame{\frametitle{Conjecture}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item Security properties can always be described in terms of past events because we are looking for when a security policy \textit{has} been broken.
%
%\item For instance, a policy might be that there should be no audio taken from the microphone if there are no calls in progress.
%
%\item In that case we would look for an audio read event to have taken place with no preceding call events.
%
%\item Pneuli describes the past temporal operators as `a symmetric counterpart to each of the future operators.  While the future formula describes a property holding at a suffix of the model (...), a past formula describes a property of a prefix of the model'

%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item Monitoring for Android security is possible.
%
%\item Requires "logic of the past".
%
%\item It is useful to monitor on abstract events.
%
%\end{itemize}
%
%It is possible to monitor for collusion without false positives if we restrict collusion to attempts within a limited timeframe.
%
%}
%
%\frame{\frametitle{Future Work}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item Systematic experimentation with the monitors.
%
%\item Monitor for more properties e.g. use of the camera or microphone.
%
%\item Extend the grammar and semantics of LTL to evaluate properties looking for collusion involving more than 2 apps.
%
%\item Evaluation of future operators by adapting the algorithm to use a three-valued variation of LTL, similar to the logic of Bauer et al.\\
%
%\item Investigate if deriving monitors for concrete events from monitors for abstract events leads to better results than using monitors derived from LTLFO.
%
%\item Cover more Android versions, integrate Xposed framework into monitor, provide a security monitoring app.
